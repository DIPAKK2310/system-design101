# System-Design:-
System design is the process of planning, structuring and defining the architecture of Software System.

Involves translating user requirements into a detailed blueprint that guides the implementation phase.
The goal is to create a well-organized and efficient structure that meets the intended purpose while considering factors like scalability, maintainability, and performance.


# System design devided into HLD & LLD

## The Perfect Analogy: Building a House
### High-Level Design (HLD) is the architect's blueprint.

- It shows the overall structure: where the rooms are, how they connect, where the plumbing and electrical lines run, and how the house fits on the property.

- It's for the client, the construction manager, and the city planner to understand the big picture.

### Low-Level Design (LLD) is the electrician's wiring diagram or the plumber's piping plan.

- It shows the exact type of wires to use, which circuit breaker connects to which outlet, the gauge of the pipes, and the specific joints and fixtures.

- It's for the specialized technicians who will actually build each component.
